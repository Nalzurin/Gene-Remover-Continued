      Original Description:
      
      An endgame solution to removing unwanted genes. Build a gene remover, cutting edge technology that allows isolation and termination of certain genes.

      In order to build one, a techprint must be acquired and the research project completed. Pawns who undergo gene removal will suffer from "genes regrowing" debuff for a while, actual duration is determined by metabolic efficiency of the targeted gene (can be changed in mod settings).

      Many thanks to Daniel for providing sources for their "Gene Ripper" mod.
